    <h2>Comparisons</h2>
    <ul>
        In JavaScript they are written like this:
        <li>Greater/less than: a > b, a < b.</li>
        <li>Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b.</li>
        <li>Equals: a == b, please note the double equality sign == means the equality test, while a single one a = b means an assignment.</li>
        <li>Not equals: In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a != b.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Boolean is the result</h2>
    <p>All comparison operators return a boolean value:</p>
    <li>true – means “yes”, “correct” or “the truth”.</li>
    <li>false – means “no”, “wrong” or “not the truth”.</li>
