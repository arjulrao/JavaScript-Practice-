/* Difference between For loop and While loop */
// while loop --> While loop is based on condition, if the condition is true then the code execute otherwise not. It is used when we don't know the number of iteration.
// for loop --> when we know the number of iteration then we use for loop. It is based on the counter. It has three parts --> begin, condition, step.
